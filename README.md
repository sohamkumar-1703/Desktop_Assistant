**Limitations**
1.Cannot work effectively with background noise - Whenever we give Jenny a command, if there is any background noise, then it might not be able to detect what exactly we are speaking.
2.Accent specific - The technology we have used in Jenny for speech recognition is built for an American accent. That’s why if the accent of a person is very different, then Jenny wont be able to understand your commands.
3.Lack of Accuracy and Misinterpretation - There are chances that while giving a command to Jenny , if we speak fast then it wont be able to understand and might misinterpret our commands.
4.Time delay to process a lengthy command - If the command given to Jenny is too long then the time taken to process the commands would increase.
